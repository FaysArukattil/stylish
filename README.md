# 🛍️ Stylish

Stylish is a **shopping app prototype** built with **Flutter & Dart**.  
The app was implemented based on a **Figma design**, turning visual mockups into a functional Flutter application.  
This project is a hands-on learning experience in mobile app development, focusing on **UI design, navigation, cart functionality, wishlist, and form validation** using **dummy data**.  

> ⚠️ Note: This is an early prototype. There is **no backend integration or payment gateway** yet.

## ✨ Features

- **Clean & Responsive UI**: Designed to match the Figma mockup, with product cards, grid view, and smooth navigation.  
- **Dummy Product Data**: Simulates a real shopping app experience.  
- **Cart System**: Add/remove items, view total price.  
- **Wishlist**: Save favorite products for later.  
- **Form Validation**: Ensures correct input in forms.  
- **Navigation Flow**: SplashScreen → OnboardingScreen → Signin → getStarted → HomeScreen → _buildGridView → Shoppage → Checkout → Placeorder → PaymentScreen → HomeScreen
-  **Navigating with Data**: Ensures Passing data from one page to another in Flutter.
